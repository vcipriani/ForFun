###Intro
This is the repository where I'm going to put my practice projects and toy problems moving forward.  Because this repository will cover independant projects, below is a summary of the folders:

####Contents
*  **3rdParty** - where I'm keeping 3rd party libraries that I could not (or did not) use a CDN for (mocha for example)  

*  **arrayMethods** - here I replicated the Array methods map, filter, reduce & each and wrote a mocha test suite to confirm that they return the same results as the original methods  

*  **kaprekarsConstant** - I just happened to read about Kaprekar's Constant the other day.  Kaprekar was a mathematician who discovered that by performing two simple steps, almost any 4 digit number can be altered to equal 6174 (within 7 step iterations).  Recreating this seemed like good functional programming  practice.  It turned out to be a perfect opportunity to practice everything.  This app includes:  
    *  Callbacks  
    *  Closures  
    *  Recursion  
    *  Modules  
    *  jQuery and Handlebars to create a simple SPA that display the steps taken to arrive at 6174
