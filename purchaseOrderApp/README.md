This was my first attempt at building a javascript application.  It uses Backbone for views and models and Parse for persistence.  I started this project very early on in my javascript experience, before I had the slightest clue what a closure was.  After spending too much time looking online for backbone specific help, I decided that I should focus on the fundamentals of javascript and quit working on this.  That being said, I was very happy that I was able to get a functioning SPA w/ persistance running.
