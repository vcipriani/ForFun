Frogger-esque Game
===============================
This is a project that HackReactor and Udacity put together.  It was really awesome to work on.  I have the core game functionality down.  The enemies move, the player can move the hero and the game stops on a collision or when the hero reaches the water.  

**To Do**  
-Reset functionality within the app instead of requiring page refresh  
-Win/loss tracking  
-Choose number of enemies  
-Zombie enemies - change the movement logic so the enemies travel in 2D and at random

**Known Bugs**  
-The game is intended to display "Game Over" or "You Win" based on the outcome.  This stopped working when I was refactoring the control logic in main().  I did not make any significant elsewhere so I am having a hard time figuring out why this quit working.
