Frogger-esque Game
===============================
This is a project that HackReactor and Udacity put together.  It was really awesome to work on.  I have the core game functionality down.  The enemies move, the player can move the hero and the game stops on a collision or when the hero reaches the water.  

**To Do**  
-Reset functionality within the app instead of requiring page refresh  
-Win/loss tracking  
-Choose number of enemies  
-Zombie enemies - change the movement logic so the enemies travel in 2D and at random
-Switch to refactored engine2.js - I refactored the code to be much cleaner; however, the "Game Over"/"Game Won" text quit working when I refactored it.  I haven't determined why as I didn't really change the function that loads the text.
